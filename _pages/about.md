## Overview

I am Ilan Valencius (pronounced a-LAWN va-LEN-chus), a first PhD student in the Earth and Environmental Science Department at Boston College. As part of [Prof. Yi Ming's](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/people/faculty-directory/yi-ming.html) research group, I use climate models to study atmospheric behavior and evolution. As part of the [Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/centers/schiller-institute.html), our group tries to perform interdisciplinary and applicable research. My current research is done in partnership with BC Economics [Professor Richard Sweeney](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/economics/people/faculty-directory/richard-l-sweeney.html) and focuses on understanding and quantifying changes in near-surface wind speeds (NSWS) in the continental United States. Understanding variations in NSWS is critically important for understanding predicted renewable energy production. 

## Background

I grew up in Quincy Massachusetts (home of two presidents and Dunkin Donuts) and attended Boston College for my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Geological Science. When I am not in the lab I enjoy hiking, skiing, and playing the guitar.
