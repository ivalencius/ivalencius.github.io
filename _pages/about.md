## Overview

I am Ilan Valencius (pronounced a-LAWN va-LEN-chus), a first PhD student in the Earth and Environmental Science Department at Boston College. As part of [Prof. Yi Ming's](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/people/faculty-directory/yi-ming.html) research group. In the Computational, Actionable Environmental Science and Resilience ([CAESAR](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/faculty-sites/caesar-lab.html)) lab, we use climate models to study atmospheric behavior and evolution. Our lab is also part of the [Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/centers/schiller-institute.html), which aims to produce interdisciplinary applied research. My current research focuses on changing atmospheric patterns in the continental United States.

## Background

I grew up in Quincy Massachusetts (home of two presidents and Dunkin Donuts) and attended Boston College for my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Geological Science. When I am not in the lab I enjoy hiking, skiing, and playing the guitar.
