Education
======
* Ph.D in Earth and Environmental Science, Boston College, 2025 (expected)
* B.S. in Geological Sciences and B.S. in Computer Science, Boston College, 2023
  - Magna Cum Laude, Scholar of the College, \\(\Phi B K\\)

Work experience
======
* __Independent Research__ (_Boston College_, May 2023 - August 2023)
  * Worked with Prof. Mark Behn to convert SiStER, a 2D geodynamic stokes solver, from MATLAB to Julia in order to improve runtime performance and usability
  * Available on GitHub: [Julias-SiStER](https://github.com/ivalencius/Julias-SiStER)

* __Scholar of the College Thesis__ (_Boston College_, May 2022 - May 2023)
  * Investigating changes in suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) along large North American rivers. SSC measurements are interpolated from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery harmonized with rating curve derived USGS in-situ SSC and discharge measurements.
  * Funded by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal & Hydraulics Laboratory ([ERDC CHL](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/CHL/))
  * Advisor: [Prof. Noah Snyder](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/people/faculty-directory/noah-snyder.html)
  * Manuscript available at [eScholarship@BC](https://dlib.bc.edu/islandora/object/bc-ir:109738)

* __Teaching Assistant__ (_Boston College_, January 2022 - May 2023)
  * SCHI2000: Spatial Data Science and Applications
  * CS3333: Computer Graphics

* __Academic Tutor__ (_Boston College_, August 2022 - December 2022)
  * Academic tutor for both computer science and environmental science courses.

* __Independent Research__ (_Boston College_, December 2021 - May 2022)
  * Developed methods to perform semantic segmentation of grayscale/RGB aerial imagery using the convolutional neural networks. Methods were implemented in a Google Colab UI to allow those without computational expertise or resources to use machine learning methods.
  * Available on GitHub: [classification-4u](https://github.com/ivalencius/classification-4u)

* __Research Assistant__ (_University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign_, January 2021 - April 2022)
  * Research assistant under Prof. Isak Ladegaard working on a National Science Foundation-funded research project on far-right/neo-nazi forums. Responsibilities included web scraping and natural language processing using the Google nGram corpus and word2vec package.
  * Principal investigator: [Prof. Isak Ladegaard](https://sociology.illinois.edu/directory/profile/isak)

* __IT Support__ (_Boston College_, August 2019 - May 2020)
  * Responsibilities included debugging and overseeing the GET mobile ordering system as well as maintaining all electronic registers on campus.

* __Research Assistant__ (_University of Massachusetts Boston School for the Environment_, June 2017 - August 2021)
  * Worked Directly under Dr. Peter Boucher to analyze the effectiveness of Terrestrial LiDAR Scanners (TLS) in regards to forest analysis. Applications include measuring insect intrusion into Northeastern Hemlock forests; namely the Harvard Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) site in central Massachusetts. Participated in joint field campaign to assess the accuracy of various scanning methodologies.
  * Worked directly under Assistant Research Professor Arthur Elmes. Used Random forest statistical modeling to produce classifications of the Harvard Forest ForestGEO plot using DESIS hyperspectral data.

Awards and Fellowships
======

* __Phi Beta Kappa (\\(\Phi B K\\)) Inductee__ (_The Phi Beta Kappa Society_, 2023)
* __Dean’s List First Honors__ (_Boston College_, 2020, 21, 22, 23)
* __Sophomore Scholar__ (_Boston College_, 2021)
  * Computer Science and Earth and Environmental Science Departments

Other Experiences and Interests
======
* __Schiller Student Advisory Board__ (February 2024 - Present)
  * The Schiller Student Advisory Board facilitates the organization of environmental, health, and energy programming at Boston College through the Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society.

* __The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Global KM-scale Hackathon__ (May 12th - May 16th, 2025)
  * Princeton University-Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
  *From the Princeton node website: "The Princeton workshop will focus on simulations performed with GFDL’s X-SHiELD (eXperimental System for High-resolution prediction on Earth-to-Local Domains) model. This hackathon is part of the larger WCRP effort to push the boundaries of climate system modeling and digital innovation globally."

* __Rossbypalooza__ (July 22nd - August 2nd 2024)
  * University of Chicago
  * From the Rossbypalooza website: "Rossbypalooza is a two-week long project-oriented summer school for people from a broad field of atmospheric, oceanic and planetary sciences. The goal is to provide a platform for interactions among students and faculty to understand climate extremes, their impacts, and their connection to climate change from various perspectives including small-to-large-scale dynamics and data-driven methodologies. The school will consist of lectures and projects where participants will work in groups to address a question of their choice, mentored by one of the faculty members."
